# XLSX to CSV Parser
This project focuses on reading, processing, and formatting CSV files using Python. It includes a Jupyter Notebook (format_csv.ipynb) that demonstrates how to manipulate CSV data for various use cases. The required Python packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If not, you can download it from python.org.

## Virtual Environment Setup
To ensure that all Python dependencies are installed in an isolated environment, it's recommended to use a virtual environment (venv).

### Steps to create and use the virtual environment:
#### 1. Navigate to the project folder
```
cd /path/to/your/project
```
#### 2. Create the virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
This will create a folder named venv in your project, which contains the virtual environment.
#### 3. Activate the virtual environment
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### 4. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Project Summary
